GimpOCD - Overseeing, Controlling, Directing
-----------------

Made for the Gregtech New Horizons modpack (minecraft)

Overview
-----------------

This is a UI for the Opencomputers Glass

Features;

Battery Widget - for monitoring power metrics

Item Monitoring - Interface with an ME system and allows selecting Items to keep track of (display on the HUD coming soon)

Level Maintaining - Like an AE level maintainer but with much more configuration available

Gregtech Machine/Multi monitoring/controlling - Displays if machines are disabled/enabled, if they are running, and allows turning them on/off. (Mostly back on due to power loss or something stupid =])
