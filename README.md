GimpOCD - Overseeing, Controlling, Directing
-----------------

Made for the Gregtech New Horizons modpack (minecraft)

Overview
-----------------

This is a UI for the Opencomputers Glass

Features;

Battery Widget - for monitoring power metrics

Item Monitoring - Interface with an ME system and allows selecting Items to keep track of (display on the HUD coming soon)

Level Maintaining - Like an AE level maintainer but with much more configuration available

Gregtech Machine/Multi monitoring/controlling - Displays if machines are disabled/enabled, if they are running, and allows turning them on/off. (Mostly back on due to power loss or something stupid =])

Highlighting Disabled machines - Creates Red Dots at Disabled machines' locations if enabled.

Highlighting Machines Requiring Maintenance - Same as above

More features coming soon!

Setup
----------------

The current required systems are an opencomputers server and a supporting opencomputers computer.

-----------

Recommended for the server;

Creative APU

4 Memory(Tier 3.5) OR BETTER

I'd be surprised if it required anything more than a Tier 1 HDD, unless you try to capture the output. Then it will easily fill a RAID array with 3 tier 3's

---------------

Recommended for the subsystem;

Tier 3 APU

1 Memory(Tier 3.5) will do it. Almost certainly requires less with 1 battery connected.. Almost certainly requires more with 100 batteries connected

A Hard Drive

Optionally, add a redstone component and configure the battery monitoring program for generator control
